                        <p>The Harding Prize for Trustworthy Communication is a new award, for public communication of information that genuinely helps people decide what to do, or helps them judge a decision by others.</p>
                        <h3 id="what-kind-of-decisions">What kind of decisions?</h3>
                        <p>Maybe the communication will help with a significant decision in daily life: about a medical treatment, a school, a financial product or a charity to donate to.</p>
                        <p>Maybe it will help people make a decision on behalf of others: perhaps if they’re policymakers, head teachers, or business leaders.</p>
                        <p>Maybe it will help people make a decision about what to think: on the pros and cons of a big, topical issue - like lockdown, say.</p>
                        <p>Or maybe it will help people assess the basis for a decision, such as the reasons for the prioritisation of vaccines or a tax policy.</p>
                        <h3 id="what-subjects-and-formats">What subjects and formats?</h3>
                        <p>Those above are just examples. The range of eligible subjects, audiences and media is wide, and could include almost anything involving a significant decision.</p>
                        <p>‘Communication' might mean a news article, a Twitter thread, a website, a leaflet, a report, original research in a journal, a podcast, TV, a speech... As long as it can be taken in within ten minutes (e.g. not a book), and you
                            can provide it to us in full for judging.</p>
                        <p>Entries must have been placed in the public domain during the twelve months before the closing date.</p>
                        <h3 id="how-will-good-be-judged">How will ‘good’ be judged?</h3>
                        <p>To aid decision-making, good communication should, above all, be trustworthy.</p>
                        <p>It should primarily serve the interests of the audience, not the communicator.</p>
                        <p>It will present evidence in a balanced and clear way, which means it should include uncertainties.</p>
                        <p>Information should be appropriate for its audience in content, length, depth and format.</p>
                        <p>And it should be clear about what it’s trying to achieve: for example, does it mainly inform, or does it try to persuade?</p>
                        <p>Note that we’re unlikely to consider advertising or political campaigning.</p>
                        <p>Judges will be chosen by members of the Winton Centre Management Board and their decision is final.</p>
                        <h3 id="the-prizes">The prizes</h3>
                        <p>There are two prizes. The Harding Prize itself for the best entry, worth £1,000, and a separate Weasel Words award open to nominations, for the worst example of miscommunication, bad evidence, or untrustworthy communication trying
                            to look like it’s being helpful.</p>
                        <p>To avoid confusion (!), please state clearly which prize you have in mind: the Harding Prize, the Weasel Words Prize... or both.</p>
                        <h3 id="who-can-enter">Who can enter?</h3>
                        <p>Anyone can submit an entry – which can either be a piece of your own work, or something that you have seen and appreciated.</p>
                        <p>In order to be awarded the Harding Prize, the originator of the communication must be correctly identifiable.</p>
                        <p>In order to be awarded the Weasel Words prize, all efforts to identify the originator of the communication will be made, but the prize can be awarded even if this identification cannot be made.</p>
                        <p>Closing date: 31st December 2021.</p>
                        <p>Winners will be notified by 1st February 2022.</p>
                        <p>The judges’ decision will be final and correspondence will not be entered into.</p>
