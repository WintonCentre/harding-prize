                    When we have a decision to make, or we want to understand someone else’s decision, we often look for a source of trustworthy evidence on the subject. Yet balanced, useful evidence can be hard to find.

                <h3>What kind of evidence?</h3>
                <p>The Harding Prizes are specifically for those who try to gather together the information that helps someone make a decision, or make their mind up about a subject, <b>without trying to tell them what to do</b>.
                </p>

                <p>It might be designed for a general audience, to help people make a significant decision in their own daily life: about their personal finances, their health, their education, or a big life change.
                </p>

                <p>It might be designed for a more specialist audience, to help those making a decision on behalf of others: perhaps if they’re policymakers, head teachers, or business leaders.</p>

                <p>Maybe it will help people make a decision about what to think: on the pros and cons of a big issue - like nuclear power, tax policies or drugs laws.
                </p>

                <h3>What subjects and formats?</h3>
                <p>Those above are just examples. The range of eligible subjects, audiences and media is wide, and could include almost anything involving a significant decision. Scroll down to see previous winners and short-listed entries to see the kind of thing that we're looking for.
                    For the 2025 prize, there will again be two categories: one for communications of evidence to a specialist audience, and one for communications to a broader, general public audience. </p>

                <p>‘Communication' might mean a news article, a social media posting, a website, a leaflet, a report, original research in a journal, a podcast, TV, a speech... As long as it can be taken in within ten minutes (e.g. not a book or a long film), and
                    you can provide it to us in full for judging. </p>

                <p>Communications must be in English but can originate from any country, worldwide. Entries must have been placed in the public domain during 2025.
                </p>

                <h3>How is ‘good’ judged?</h3>
                <p>To aid decision-making, good communication should, above all, be trustworthy. It should primarily serve the interests of the audience, not the communicator. It will present evidence in a balanced and clear way, and it should include
                    uncertainties and limitations of the evidence.
                </p>
                <p>Information should be appropriate for its audience in content, length, depth and format. And it should be clear about what it’s trying to achieve: who is it helping, and what decision are they making?
                </p>

                <h3>The prize</h3>
                <p>Each Harding Prize is worth <b>£3,141.59</b> to celebrate the number π.</p>

                <h3>Judging panel</h3>

                <p>
                    The final Harding Prize winners will be chosen by a panel including: David Spiegelhalter, Alf Collins, David Schley and Alexandra Freeman.

                    <h3>2024's Winners</h3>
                    <p>In 2024 the judges awarded two Harding Prizes for Trustworthy Communication - one for a general and one for a specialist audience</p>

                    <p>The article by the reporter <b>Michael Le Page</b> for the New Scientist on whether <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2422260-should-everyone-start-eating-snakes-to-save-the-planet/">everyone should start eating snakes to save the planet</a> won the General Public Audience Award. 
                        The judges thought that <i>“This fascinating topic was covered in an elegant and concise manner, offering balanced information”</i> and pointed out that <i>“the article provided a refreshing and interesting angle while at the same time avoiding the sensationalist trap.”</i>.</p>
                    
                    <p>The research blog on <a href="https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/research/research-blog/trials-treatments/stem-cell-therapy-parkinsons-are-we-getting-closer">Parkinson's UK website on Stem cell therapy</a> by lead author <b>Emma Rodgers</b> and contributing authors <b>Becky Jones</b> and <b>Katherine Fletcher</b> won the Specialist Audience Award. 
                        The judges commented that <i>“it was really clear, easy to read summary that would help patients and their families.”</i>. They pointed out that <i>“for a charity focussed on a single disease, it is particularly refreshing to see something this balanced”</i> and stated that they <i>“particularly appreciated the final paragraph which gave an important warning about over-optimism without pouring cold water on hope”</i>.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>

                            The high standard of the entries for this competition shows that, among all the exaggerations and misinformation, there are also many trustworthy sources of information. We are so pleased to recognise and celebrate the best of these."</blockquote></p>

                    <h3>2023's Winners</h3>
                    <p>In 2023 the prize was again awarded to two categories: one for communication for a general public audience and one for an expert audience.</p>

                    <p><b>Clare Wilson</b>’s feature article won the General Public Audience Award. The article focused on <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25734303-400-new-dna-tests-predict-your-disease-risk-are-we-ready-for-them/">new DNA tests that are used to predict disease risk</a>. The judges thought that “in a field of glittering promises, this was a clear, impartial, evidence based exploration into what’s currently known about polygenetic testing and whether it is useful to the individual.” 
                        They stressed that “the article presented the benefits and problems of the tests in a balanced and thoughtful way…” and that the article was tailored to the needs of the targeted audience and “did not duck the open questions and uncertainties in the research.”</p>

                    <p><b>Katharine Lang</b>’s specialist article addressed on <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/382/bmj.p1666.full">the use of Paxlovid and other Covid antivirals in current treatment regimes</a> and won the Specialist Audience Award. The judges commented that this short pithy piece targeted at busy doctors <i>“successfully offered prescribing practitioners solid information in a complex and evolving field.”</i>. 
                        The judges felt that Lang <i>“broke down their piece into a series of key questions which might be asked by clinicians and suggested a balanced range of evidence and well sourced expert opinion in response. This approach acknowledged the individual judgements involved in the prescribing process whilst sharing the latest insights in an informed and accessible format.

                    <blockquote><p></p>“I congratulate the winners for their trustworthy communication!  They deal with important and complex issues - polygenic risk scores and Covid treatments - and deliberately engage with a variety of viewpoints. They raise the understanding of their audiences, without trying to persuade them of a particular point-of-view.  Just what we need."</blockquote></p>

                    <h3>2022's Winners</h3>

                    <p style="color: grey">In 2022 we decided to have two categories of winner: one for information for a public audience and one for an expert audience.</p>
                    <p>
                        The <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/calculators/what-could-happen-nhs-waiting-lists-england" target="_blank">IFS’s interactive NHS waiting list calculator</a> allows people to play around with ‘what if…’ scenarios to see the
                        effect of different factors on NHS waiting lists. The judges thought that this was a ‘ground breaking’ piece of communication worthy of the Public Audience Award. <i>“Given the importance of data in our society”</i>, said
                        one judge, <i>“playing with this tool, 
                        I feel I have seen the future in democratising the models which increasingly shape our lives.”</i>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What was particularly important was that it shows <i>“how mathematical models which affect real life decision making are subject to change when the assumptions 
                        and parameters behind them change, and so the uncertainties and the challenges of using data to reach conclusions.”</i>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The <a href="https://post.parliament.uk/research-briefings/post-pn-0672/" target="_blank">Parliamentary Office of Science &amp; Technology’s ’Green Steel’ briefing for MPs</a>, on how steel production in the UK, responsible
                        for about 2% of the UK’s total greenhouse gas emissions, can be decarbonised, won the Expert Audience Award. The judges commented that this was
                        <i>“an excellent example of a complex technical subject explained with superb clarity. Its tone of detached, thoughtful authority was consistently 
                            accessible and jargon free. The document offered very detailed references; the limitations of the evidence were included and at no point did the 
                            document attempt to steer the reader to a particular viewpoint.”</i>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They added that <i>“The risk of overwhelming the reader was deftly avoided by a clear layout and strong sign posting. The Overview Box and two other boxes 
                            outlining background information, were models of accurate efficiency.”</i>

                            telling one side of the story. This prize celebrates those who genuinely try and tell it how it is, to help us all understand more and make better decisions. All the shortlisted entries deserve our sincere congratulations."

                        The ONS Covid Infection Survey are using their prize money to support lectures, presentations and events in Universities, themed around ‘statistics for the public good’. They are targeting universities with a high proportion of students from under-represented
                        backgrounds to highlight the importance of our data for shaping government policy and therefore encourage them to take up a career in statistics.
